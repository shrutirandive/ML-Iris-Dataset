# Machine Learning-Iris-Dataset

The iris dataset contains the following data:
- 50 samples of 3 different species of iris (150 samples total)
- Measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

- **Classification**: samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data.

- **Regression**: if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a function of its age and weight.

Before we start, we need to clear some ML notations:

- **Attributes**-->An attribute is a property of an instance that may be used to determine its classification. In the following dataset, the attributes are the **petal and sepal length and width**. It is also known as **Features**.

- **Target variable**---> the variable that is or should be the output. Here the target variables are the **3 flower species**

Now the given problem is a classification problem.. Thus we will be using the classification algorithms to build a model.

#### We will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on these parameters and the accuracy using various ML algorithms like:
- Logistic regression
- Decision trees
- KMeans clustering
- SVM
